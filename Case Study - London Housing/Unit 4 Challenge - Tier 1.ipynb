    "## Objectives\n",
    "Hey! Great job getting through those challenging DataCamp courses. You're learning a lot in a short span of time - so let's apply your knowledge in the real world. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we're going to apply the skills you've been learning, bridging the gap between the controlled environment of DataCamp and the *slightly* messier work that data scientists do with actual datasets!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the mystery we’re going to solve: ***which boroughs of London have seen the greatest increase in housing prices, on average, over the last two decades?***\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A borough is just a fancy word for district. You may be familiar with the five boroughs of New York… [well, there are 32 boroughs within Greater London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_boroughs). Some of them are more desirable areas to live in, and the data will reflect that with a greater rise in housing prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the Tier One notebook, which is the easiest tier. More of the code has been filled in already for you, so you have to less research on how to complete the lines. We ask that you only complete this tier if you've given Tiers Two and Three your best effort and been thwarted. We also ask, once you complete this tier, to go back to the highest difficulty level and give it another go. We really want you to internalize the skills you're learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge will make use of only what you learned in the following DataCamp courses: \n",
    "- Prework courses (Introduction to Python for Data Science, Intermediate Python for Data Science)\n",
    "- Data Types for Data Science\n",
    "- Python Data Science Toolbox (Part One) \n",
    "- pandas Foundations\n",
    "- Manipulating DataFrames with pandas\n",
    "- Merging DataFrames with pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the tools, techniques and concepts in the above DataCamp courses, this challenge should require the application of the following: \n",
    "- **pandas**\n",
    "    - **data ingestion and inspection** (pandas Foundations, Module One) \n",
    "    - **exploratory data analysis** (pandas Foundations, Module Two)\n",
    "    - **tidying and cleaning** (Manipulating DataFrames with pandas, Module Three) \n",

    "    - **grouping data** (Manipulating DataFrames with pandas, Module Four) \n",
    "    - **melting data** (Manipulating DataFrames with pandas, Module Three) \n",
    "    - **advanced indexing** (Manipulating DataFrames with pandas, Module Four) \n",

    "Data Science is magical. In this case study, you'll get to apply some complex machine learning algorithms. But as  [David Spiegelhalter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUs1uvsz0Ok) reminds us, there is no substitute for simply **taking a really, really good look at the data.** Sometimes, this is all we need to answer our question.\n",

    "**Note**: you can change the 'Unnamed: 0' name of the first column just by including that string as a key in our dictionary, but 'NaN' stands for Not A Number,  and is denoted by *pd.NaT*. Do not use quotes when you include this value. NaN means Not A Number, and NaT means Not A Time - both of these values represent undefined or unrepresenable values like 0/0. They are functionally Null values. Don't worry, we'll help you with this.\n",
